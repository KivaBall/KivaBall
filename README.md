Hi! I am a .NET developer with over 1.5 years of programming experience on this platform. My specialization is backend development for various web applications and services

I have experience working with a wide range of libraries and tools. I'm proficient with **Entity Framework Core**, **Dapper**, **Redis**, **Serilog**, and more. Additionally, I have a foundational understanding of **Azure** and **Docker**, which I utilize for deployment and cloud-based services

In terms of databases, my primary focus is **PostgreSQL**, but I also have hands-on experience with other database systems. For testing, I rely on **xUnit**, ensuring code quality and reliability
